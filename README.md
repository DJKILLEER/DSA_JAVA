## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Java codes written during my DSA class. The codes cover a variety of fundamental and advanced topics in data structures and algorithms, aimed at reinforcing theoretical knowledge through practical implementation.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- Implementation of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Common algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
- Code for solving typical DSA problems covered in class assignments and practice sessions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-java-codes.git](https://github.com/DJKILLEER/DSA_JAVA.git)
